"""Finds the tables a SELECT reads twice for the same rows, which the transpiler must never generate.

A read is one FROM target: a table or its alias, a LATERAL, a CTE or a derived table, at any depth (subqueries,
EXISTS). Two reads are duplicates when they have the same base table, or the same body, and the same correlation:
the column equalities tying the target to another FROM, in its ON clause or WHERE, or else those of its subquery.
Alias names never count; columns are compared by the base table they belong to.
